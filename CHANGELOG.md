- Added helper methods for tracking transactions: `trackTransaction:items:` and `trackTransaction:items:properties:`
- Added helper initialiser for `GSTransactionItem`s: `transactionItemWithName:price:quantity:`

### Changed

- Deprecated `GSTrackerEvent`. Use `trackEvent:withProperties:` method instead
